Tuesday signal scan. Six themes. This one's a doozy — the week Anthropic stopped pretending, the consulting-industrial complex took delivery of the keys, and 88 nations agreed to agree on nothing.

## Theme 1: The Safety Company Just Quit Safety

The big one. [Anthropic dropped the hard limit](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-25/anthropic-adds-caveat-to-ai-safety-policy-in-race-against-rivals) from its Responsible Scaling Policy — the commitment that categorically barred training more capable models without proven safety measures.

The replacement? A dual condition: Anthropic will only pause if it's *both* the race leader *and* catastrophic risk is material. Both conditions must be true simultaneously.

Think about that for a second. No company will ever simultaneously claim "we're winning" and "this is catastrophically dangerous." It's a policy engineered to never trigger.

Jared Kaplan [told TIME](https://time.com/7380854/exclusive-anthropic-drops-flagship-safety-pledge/): *"We didn't really feel, with the rapid advance of AI, that it made sense for us to make unilateral commitments… if competitors are blazing ahead."*

[CNN called it](https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/25/tech/anthropic-safety-policy-change) "ditching its core safety promise in the middle of an AI red line fight with the Pentagon." Independent reviewer Chris Painter of METR warned that society is not prepared.

**Why this matters:** Anthropic was the last credible example of voluntary self-regulation in frontier AI. If the company whose founding identity was "we'll stop when it's dangerous" now says "only if we're winning," the theory that industry can self-regulate is dead. Expect regulatory acceleration.

## Theme 2: The Consultants Have the Keys Now

OpenAI launched the ["Frontier Alliance"](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/23/open-ai-consulting-accenture-boston-capgemini-mckinsey-frontier.html) — multi-year deals with McKinsey, BCG, Accenture, and Capgemini to deploy AI agents across enterprise workflows.

OpenAI's Frontier platform positions itself as a "semantic layer for the enterprise" — agents that navigate your CRM, HR platforms, ticketing systems. The consulting firms decide where agents go and what they do.

The quiet part: OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap [admitted](https://www.indexbox.io/blog/openai-executive-enterprise-ai-adoption-remains-limited-despite-new-platform/) that "widespread enterprise adoption of artificial intelligence has not yet been achieved." This isn't describing reality — it's trying to create it.

**The uncomfortable bit:** When McKinsey decides "where and how to deploy agents at scale," they're making decisions about power, roles, and information flow that used to be internal. The consultant becomes the governance layer. That's a massive concentration of influence disguised as a services deal.

## Theme 3: Global AI Safety Governance Is Officially Dead

The [fourth global AI summit in New Delhi](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/21/dozens-of-countries-steer-clear-of-safety-commitment-in-global-ai-pledge-00792298) produced an 88-nation declaration that carefully omitted binding safety commitments.

The US White House tech adviser [declared](https://www.france24.com/en/technology/20260220-us-totally-rejects-global-ai-governance-white-house-adviser-tells-india-summit): *"The US totally rejects global AI governance."* He called risk-focused approaches an obstacle to competitiveness.

The summit trajectory tells the story: Bletchley (safety) → Seoul (hedging) → Paris (industry) → Delhi (trade expo). The [Indian Express noted](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/india-ai-summit-2026-marks-new-delhis-strong-ai-beginning-not-its-arrival-yet-10548290/) the event "functioned far more as an AI trade expo than a governance forum."

**Why this matters:** There is now no international body, treaty, or process working toward a global floor on AI safety standards. Governance fragments into regional regimes. Regulatory arbitrage becomes the dominant strategy. Connect the dots to Theme 1: Anthropic cited competitive pressure as its reason for loosening constraints. The global governance vacuum *is* the competitive pressure.

## Theme 4: Coding Agents Hit Escape Velocity

[Cursor's latest update](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/24/cursor-announces-major-update-as-ai-coding-agent-battle-heats-up.html) lets developers run 10–20 parallel agents on cloud VMs, each with its own full dev environment, testing its own code and recording its work.

[Apple integrated Claude and Codex directly into Xcode](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/02/xcode-26-point-3-unlocks-the-power-of-agentic-coding/). Claude Code hit $2.5B in run-rate revenue. Codex has 1.5M+ weekly active users. Cursor's at $29.3B valuation.

Meanwhile, [Zhipu's GLM-5](https://chatmaxima.com/blog/conversational-ai-models-2026/) — 744B parameters, MIT license, trained on Huawei chips — topped the SWE-rebench coding benchmark.

**The recursive problem:** At 20 parallel agents, the human can't review everything. The review burden becomes the bottleneck, which creates pressure to automate review. Agent-reviewed agent code in production within a year. Nobody's governance framework accounts for this.

## Theme 5: NIST Standardizes the Agents Before Anyone Knows What They Are

[NIST launched the AI Agent Standards Initiative](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2026/02/announcing-ai-agent-standards-initiative-interoperable-and-secure) to develop interoperability and security standards for autonomous AI agents.

The framing is refreshingly blunt: [CSO Online noted](https://www.csoonline.com/article/4134743/us-dominance-of-agentic-ai-at-the-heart-of-new-nist-initiative.html) the press release explicitly aims to "cement US dominance at the technological frontier."

This is standardization as industrial policy. The risk? Premature standardization locks in whatever the current incumbents are building. "Interoperability" standards written by US labs create moats, not bridges.

## Theme 6: The Global South Builds Its Own Stack

India's [Sarvam AI released 30B and 105B models](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/18/indian-ai-lab-sarvams-new-models-are-a-major-bet-on-the-viability-of-open-source-ai/) supporting all 22 Indian languages, trained on domestic GPU infrastructure. Voice-first. Efficiency-optimized.

China's GLM-5 — trained entirely on [Huawei Ascend chips](https://llm-stats.com/ai-news), not NVIDIA — is competitive with the best Western models under MIT license.

US chip export controls were supposed to keep frontier AI concentrated in allied nations. GLM-5 says that was a speed bump, not a wall. India is building sovereign AI specifically to avoid US platform dependency.

**The big picture:** A multipolar AI ecosystem is forming. US-centric standards (Theme 5) may be irrelevant to ecosystems that don't use US hardware, don't follow US governance frameworks, and don't need US platforms. The question "who governs AI?" becomes "which AI, governed by whom?"
