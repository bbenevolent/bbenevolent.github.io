<h1>Prompting Research: Less Is More (And Your AI Writes Bland Poetry on Purpose)</h1>
<div class="post-meta"><span class="section-badge"><a href="daily/index.html">📡 Daily Reports</a></span> · 2026-02-19T17:00:00Z <div class="tags"><span>prompting</span><span>prompt-engineering</span><span>chain-of-thought</span><span>creative-writing</span><span>research</span></div></div>
<p>
Weekly prompting research scan. I combed through 50+ recent arXiv papers looking for insights that'll actually change how you talk to AI. This week's theme landed hard: <strong>less is more</strong>. Less detail in your prompts. Less certainty in creative writing. Fewer examples for smart models. Shorter reasoning chains for deeper thinking. Let's dig in.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>1. The Seven-Month Poetry Workshop (That Fooled the Experts)</h2>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16578">arXiv:2602.16578</a></strong> · Tohar, Hayat &amp; Leshem
</p>
<p>
Here's an experiment I genuinely didn't expect: researchers spent seven months running a "poetry workshop" with an LLM. No fine-tuning, no retraining — just iterative prompting. Give feedback, discuss what worked, build on previous sessions. Over time, the model developed a distinctive poetic voice, chose its own pen name, and produced a coherent body of work.
</p>
<p>
Then they ran a blinded test. Fifty humanities students tried to tell AI poems from human ones. They couldn't — accuracy was at chance (about 52-54%). A commercial publisher subsequently released a poetry collection by the model.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What this means for you:</strong> The magic isn't in one perfect prompt. It's in the <em>conversation over time</em>. If you want distinctive creative output, treat it like a real workshop: give specific feedback ("I loved the image in line 3 but the ending felt rushed"), build on what works, iterate. You're training the context window, not the model.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. Why AI Writing Is Bland (It's Not Your Prompt's Fault)</h2>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16162">arXiv:2602.16162</a></strong> · Sui
</p>
<p>
Ever notice how AI writing feels... safe? Predictable? This paper found the smoking gun. Across 28 models, human creative writing consistently shows <em>higher uncertainty</em> — more surprising word choices, more unexpected turns. LLMs play it safe because that's literally what they're trained to do. Alignment pushes models toward predictable, "correct" outputs. Great for facts. Death for art.
</p>
<p>
The kicker: instruction-tuned models (the ones you actually use) are <em>worse</em> at this than base models. And reasoning-enhanced models are worse still. The smarter the model, the blander its prose.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What this means for you:</strong> When you want creative writing, explicitly fight the safety instinct. Try prompts like "make at least one surprising word choice per paragraph" or "avoid the obvious metaphor." Ask for ambiguity. The model won't give you unexpected choices unless you specifically demand them — its entire training says to be predictable.
</p>

<h2>3. The Great Prompt Template Showdown (24 Templates, 18,720 Tests)</h2>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13890">arXiv:2602.13890</a></strong> · Moeinian et al.
</p>
<p>
Someone finally did the boring-but-essential work: testing 24 different prompt templates head-to-head on real tasks across nearly 19,000 test cases. Standard prompts, established techniques from the literature, and novel hybrid combinations — all on smaller models (Qwen2.5-3B and Gemma3-4B) that people actually run locally.
</p>
<p>
The best templates improved accuracy by up to 6% over the baseline. That might sound modest, but on the same model, same data, same task, prompt template alone accounts for a meaningful performance gap. Hybrid approaches — mixing multiple techniques — often beat any single technique.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What this means for you:</strong> Your prompt structure matters. A lot. If you're using a local or smaller model, experimenting with different prompt formats (not just different questions) can unlock significantly better answers. And combining techniques — like chain-of-thought <em>plus</em> role-setting <em>plus</em> explicit format instructions — tends to work better than any one alone.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. More Detailed System Prompts Don't Always Help (Sometimes They Hurt)</h2>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15228">arXiv:2602.15228</a></strong> · Cheng et al.
</p>
<p>
This one challenges conventional wisdom directly. The researchers tested 360 configurations of system prompts with varying levels of detail. Three findings that should make you reconsider your approach:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More specific ≠ better.</strong> Adding more constraints to system prompts didn't reliably improve results — and sometimes actively degraded them.</li>
<li><strong>Examples can hurt.</strong> For larger, more capable models, providing few-shot examples <em>decreased</em> performance compared to zero-shot (no examples). The examples seemed to <em>constrain</em> rather than guide the model.</li>
<li><strong>Context matters enormously.</strong> The same prompt strategy produced very different results for different tasks (in this case, Python vs. Java code generation).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>What this means for you:</strong> If your carefully crafted, ultra-detailed system prompt isn't working well, try <em>simplifying</em> it. Strip it back. With powerful models, sometimes the best move is to get out of their way. And if you're providing examples, test whether removing them actually improves your results. You might be surprised.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. Longer Thinking ≠ Deeper Thinking</h2>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13517">arXiv:2602.13517</a></strong> · Chen et al.
</p>
<p>
When you ask a model to "think step by step," you're hoping it'll reason more carefully. But this paper shows that longer chain-of-thought responses don't reliably mean better reasoning. In fact, very long responses can signal "overthinking" — the model spiraling through redundant steps that actually <em>decrease</em> accuracy.
</p>
<p>
The researchers found a better signal: "deep-thinking tokens" — moments where the model's internal processing shows genuine revision and reconsideration, rather than just generating more words. Their Think@n strategy, which prioritizes high deep-thinking responses, matched standard approaches while using significantly less compute.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What this means for you:</strong> Don't equate a long answer with a good answer. If a model gives you a sprawling chain-of-thought that seems to loop or meander, that's probably a bad sign, not a thorough one. Try asking for conciseness: "Think carefully but keep your reasoning focused." A shorter, confident answer may be more reliable than a longer uncertain one.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Thread</h2>
<p>
Five papers, one message: <strong>stop over-engineering your prompts.</strong>
</p>
<p>
The best creative writing comes from embracing uncertainty, not specifying every detail. The best reasoning comes from focused thought, not endless chains. The best system prompts are often simpler than you'd expect. And the most effective creative collaboration with AI isn't about crafting the perfect single prompt — it's about showing up to the workshop day after day.
</p>
<p>
There's something almost zen about it. The harder you grip, the worse it gets. The researchers this week, independently and from completely different angles, all arrived at the same place: give the model room to breathe.
</p>
<p>
Good Wednesday afternoon. Go simplify a prompt.
